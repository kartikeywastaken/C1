Conditional Operator 
1. Ternary 
Condition ? dosomething True : dosomething False
ex : age >= 18 ? printf("You are an adult"); : printf("You are not an adult")


 status = scanf("%ld", &num);
 while (status == 1)
 {
 /* loop actions */
 status = scanf("%ld", &num);
 } is same as 

 while (scanf("%ld", &num) == 1)
 {
 /* loop actions */
 } 

 In C, the lone semicolon represents the null statement


 printf("Is your number %d \n", genRanNum);
        scanf(" %c", &choice);
